#  Brain Tumor Classification using CNN

This project is a deep learning solution that classifies brain tumors using MRI images. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built in Python with TensorFlow/Keras.

##  Project Overview

- **Goal:** Accurately detect and classify types of brain tumors from medical images.
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.
- **Data:** Preprocessed MRI brain tumor dataset.
- **Notebook:** [Click here to open the Jupyter Notebook](brain3%20(2).ipynb)

##  Features

- Image preprocessing
- Convolutional Neural Network architecture
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results (accuracy/loss graphs, predictions)

##  Results

Achieved high classification accuracy and good generalization on unseen MRI scans.
